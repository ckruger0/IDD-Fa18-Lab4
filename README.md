# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Chris Kruger - crk78*

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your vibration motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard<BR>

Yellow wire to signal, red wire to 5v power, and brown wire to ground. 

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**<BR>
 Pin 9

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**<BR>
Decreasing the number in the `delay()` portion of the code increases speed, while increasing it decreases servo speed. Angle is controlled in the range for the `for()` loop, changing pos range from 0-180 to different values.

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**
